Recital evening. The school had it every six months and several others had been up on the stage first. Now it was Adrien's turn. The piano sang, every note was perfect and every tone opened the heart. It was a sad dirge. Every other song had been happy and fun but this...

It was sad. Expressive and spoke of a pain very few could touch. He tapped away at the keys, racing into a crescendo of hard and vivid tones. Finally with a set of repeating chords the stage went black. The crowd hesitated, unsure a few hands came in applause before the rest keyed in. Adrien stood and turned from the stage, heading backstage and letting out a sigh. He tapped his ring and whispered. "For you mom."
