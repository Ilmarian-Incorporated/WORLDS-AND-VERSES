# Character
[[William Blake]]

# Starter
I was having a nightmare.

I knew it, in the same way that you know when you're asleep but even when you know, it's still real.

The voice on the other side of the phone was me.

He said I was going to die.

He said she was going to die.

Who, they didn't say. It burned my heart.

I'd fail again.
