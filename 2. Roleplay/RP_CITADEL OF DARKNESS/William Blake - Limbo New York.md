[[William Blake]]

# Starter
Blake walked through the dimly lit streets of New York, or at least, a distorted version of it within Limbo. The cityscape loomed with skyscrapers that stretched into the abyss above, their outlines merging with the inky darkness. The air was thick with an otherworldly quiet, broken only by the distant echoes of footsteps that seemed to resonate from nowhere.

The familiar landmarks of the city were both recognizable and twisted, casting long, distorted shadows on the cobblestone streets. Neon signs flickered intermittently, casting an eerie glow that danced upon the surfaces of forgotten storefronts. The buildings, though bearing the architectural familiarity of New York, exuded an ominous aura, as if concealing secrets woven into the fabric of this surreal urban tapestry.

Blake's senses were on edge as he navigated the labyrinthine alleys and forgotten corners, each step echoing in the emptiness around him. The city seemed to shift with each turn, a maze that defied the logic of its tangible counterpart. It was New York, yet it was notâ€”a dreamscape where reality and imagination intertwined in a dance of uncertainty.

As he ventured deeper into the urban labyrinth, the city's ambient sounds became distorted whispers, the distant hum of traffic replaced by an otherworldly symphony. Shadows clung to the edges of the buildings, taking on shapes that defied the laws of physics. The city, wrapped in a shroud of darkness, held an enigmatic allure, inviting Blake to explore its mysteries.

In this surreal iteration of New York, every alleyway held the potential for discovery, every flickering streetlight hinted at secrets waiting to be unveiled. As Blake moved through the twisted streets, he couldn't shake the feeling that Limbo, in its infinite creativity, had woven a version of the city that mirrored the shadows of his own imagination. The journey ahead promised both trepidation and revelation, a narrative waiting to unfold in the heart of this dark, ever-shifting urban dreamscape.
