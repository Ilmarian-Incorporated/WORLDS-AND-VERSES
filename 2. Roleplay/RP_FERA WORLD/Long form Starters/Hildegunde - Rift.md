A crickle, a crackle. A hiss and a Snap.

In the darkness of night, a flash of light began to grow from a pin point position in the air a few feet off the ground. Slowly this began to grow until it was the size of a person and something came through the shimmering hole.

It was a small box, a brick in fact. Tied to a rope it began to come back through the hole.

A few moments later and a figure stepped through. The figure was wearing a large divers bell suit and dragged a long air tube through the rift. A light flickered on top of the diver and the figure tapped the light fixture until it went out. Turning slowly, the figure pulled off a small magazine from their belt and threw it through the hole.

A few moments later the rest arrived. Ten figures, all dressed the same. They held rifles in their hands and circled out in a defensive circle. Looking back at the hole, it began to shimmer and then shut quickly, cutting off the air hoses.

With a sigh, one of the figures unbolted the helmet of their suit and threw it to the ground. This figure was shorter than the rest of them by a good few heads. Almost child like compared to the adults around them.

"Get these damn suits off. The air is breathable and we have six hours before the next opening. When they do, we need to have a FOB set up." Hildegunde von Vernicthung spat on the floor as she threw the helmet to the floor, starting to get out of her suit.

"Sir, the radio's are broken." One of the soldiers spoke.

"So are the lights." Another added.

"Guess the rift broke them, we'll get some parts together and fix them." She ordered and looked around in the dark. It was a forest, deep inside. They'd a nice place to hide.

"Get us set up and we'll scout ahead." She ordered the other soldiers, three more coming with her as she began to sneak through the forrest.
