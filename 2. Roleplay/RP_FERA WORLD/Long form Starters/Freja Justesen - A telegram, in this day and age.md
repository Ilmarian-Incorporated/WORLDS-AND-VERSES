# Starter
In the heart of the bustling Amstadt, its place at the caldera of a massive super volcano that stretched for miles around. The streets buzzed with the hum of vehicles and the constant chatter of people around.

With a polite but out-of-place tip of his hat, a man approached, the officer extended a piece of paper toward her. It was a telegram, an archaic medium of communication that had long since been replaced by the rapid exchange of data through internet. Once she accepted the telegram, her fingers brushing against the coarse paper, and had unfolded it, the man was no where to be seen; the streets were busy but not enough for someone to disappear in such a way entirely.

The message was brief, handwritten in elegant script with the dots and dashes of the Code used from the Telegraph machine it had come from. The message was simple.

"The Ancient House awaits." And then on the next line, an address. " Building 4. 162nd Main Street, Amstadt."

That was not far from where she stood.

On the street, at the exact address mentioned, was The Ancient House, as named from a small brass plaque stood in a concrete block in front of the doors on the main street.

The Ancient House Stood as a monolithic behemoth amidst the modern skyline of Amstadt. It a stark contrast to the sleek glass and steel structures that surround it. This Brutalist masterpiece appears as if it were carved from a single massive block of concrete, its surface marred only by the occasional crack or scar, as though it has borne witness to countless secrets and upheavals over the years.

The building's exterior was a testament to its age, and it loomed over the city like a brooding sentinel of the unknown. The fa√ßade is a labyrinth of sharp angles and stark, geometric shapes, a testament to the architectural style of the mid-20th century. Rows of small, rectangular windows are scattered irregularly across the surface, their glass dark and inscrutable, revealing nothing of the mysteries contained within.

At certain angles, the Ancient House seemed to shift and change, its dimensions warping in ways that defy the laws of physics. It could appear both colossal and minuscule, depending on one's perspective, an optical illusion that adds to its eerie, otherworldly allure.

The building's entrance, a massive set of double doors, appears almost foreboding. They are adorned with a peculiar geometric pattern, a symbol of the something's presence within. Above the doors, a massive stone eagle, its wings outstretched, perches menacingly and holding a globe of Fera in each of its claws, as though guarding the secrets held within.

Entering the building, one was met by the usual bustle of a governmental buildings lobby. Marble floor, bright but old light fixtures and a long desk blocking the way in with a set of elevators behind, a huge logo on the rear wall and the floor in front of the desk listed the buildings occupants as "The Bureau of Aetherial, Temporal and Dimensional Affairs."

"Good Evening. How can I help you today?" A young man in a formal white shirt, black trousers and a black tie smiled, his name tag "Kevin - First Class.".

When shown the telegram, the lad sighed, shook his head and pressed a buzzer on the desk, speaking into an elongated microphone piece. "Yes, It's Front Desk. It's done it again." he would say, the voice crackly coming back through the tinny speaker.

"We'll have someone come down and attend."

"Thank you." Kevin - First Class said softly and looked back at them. "If you would just take a seat for a moment, someone will be here to assist." He smiled and went to work tapping away at his type writer. Another oddity in this modern age.

A few minutes later and one of the elevators pinged open, a young red head woman stepping over, her heels clacking on the marble floor.

"Sorry for the wait. My name is Freja Justesen. I see you have received an invitation from The Ancient House., If you would like to follow me, we can begin the tour and induction."
