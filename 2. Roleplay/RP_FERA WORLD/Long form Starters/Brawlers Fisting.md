[[Tola Clérico]]

# Starter
It was late into the evening of a Godsnight, the middle of winter and the closing days of the year of 1911. It was snowing outside, the weather had took a turn for the worst and it would certainly ice up overnight. Minus 11 outside, those living on the streets were huddled up in whatever they could find and some would certainly die. 

Tola Clérico was not going to be one of them tonight. She fell back against the wooden boards of the make-shift ring and threw out another punch to get the bastard of a Half-Orc off her. He moved back out of range but only for a second as he came in swinging gain. She had only just managed to throw up her fists to block the swings but it was like a locomotive had hit her. 

Gasping out for air, she ducked out of his next swing and moved into the middle of the ring. 

"That all you got?" She taunted and swung out her fists as if cocking a pair of shotguns. Spitting blood to one side, she came in quickly. three hits from the right, two from the left and a left-right-left-right series of blows. the Half-Orc hit the wooden boards hard and with a wide swing tried to get her off him. 

Tola ducked and swung a swing right at his broken tusked jaw and the leather wraps on her wrists only just stopped her from cutting open her knuckles. "The Beast from the North" dropped like a sack of bricks and the crowd cheered and boo'ed. Bets had been made, bets had been lost.
