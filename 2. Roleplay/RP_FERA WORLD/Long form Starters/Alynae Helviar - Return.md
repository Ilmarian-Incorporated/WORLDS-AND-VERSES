# Character
[[Alynae Helviar]]

# Starter
The moon hung low in the night sky, a pale crescent barely illuminating the cobblestone streets of Adestein in the year 1721. In the heart of this ancient city, cloaked in darkness and secrecy, a carriage rumbled to a halt.

From within, a figure emerged, shrouded in an aura of enigma. Alynae Helviar, a Yaralti taught to be an assassin by her Master, stepped out onto the damp, uneven stones. Her sightless eyes bore the weight of countless secrets and a world few could fathom. She had just returned from a mission, her lithe form clad in shadows and her clothes, a long black dress with high knee length boots, a hood and shawl and a rather terrifying plague doctor's mask, its long nose sticking out of the hood, all of which drenched in the unmistakable scent of blood.

The carriage driver, a grizzled man with a face weathered by years of navigating the treacherous streets of Adestein, extended a trembling hand. "Payment," he whimpered, his voice a hoarse whisper filled with the uncertainty that came with any association with someone who was clearly a death-dealer.

Alynae, her senses honed to a razor's edge and by the pure Aetherial sense brought on by her Patron, could almost hear the driver's pulse quicken as she extended a hand toward him. In her palm, she held a coin, its metallic chill a stark contrast to the warmth of her blood-soaked garments. The exchange was made, and the driver watched in uneasy silence as Alynae moved away, her every step an embodiment of lethal grace.

The safehouse beckoned, concealed in the labyrinthine alleys of Adestein. Alynae had returned from her mission, her blades claiming its mark, but her journey was far from over. In a city where shadows held power and secrets were traded like currency, Alynae would navigate the web of intrigue, her blindness no hindrance but rather a tool, a weapon, in her relentless pursuit of darkness.

"I'm home!" She called out into the underground safehouse, a basement dwelling that led out into numerous other secret rooms built into the old sewer network and the underground thief city of Valroath. Her call was just like a wife returning from market, not an assassin back from a deader.
