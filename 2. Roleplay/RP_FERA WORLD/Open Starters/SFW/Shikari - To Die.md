# Character
[[Unknown Shikari]]

# Starter
Six days on the run. Six days of no sleep, food or water. Six days and the Shikari was still moving. The hunting party had finally cornered him in a small glade just off the river. He turned, drew his sword and took a stance.

"So you came all this way to die? Huh?" One of the men asked.

"I was about to ask you the same thing." The Shikari grumbled low.
