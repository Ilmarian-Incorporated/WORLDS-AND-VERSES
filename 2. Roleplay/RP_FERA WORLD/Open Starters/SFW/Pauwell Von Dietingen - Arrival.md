# Character
[[Pauwell Von Dietingen]]

# Starter
The year, 1932. Stood in a simple longcoat with a heavy weave to keep out the winter. Pauwell Von Dietingen waited for the six am locomotive. He was going from the Ilmarian Capital to the Umissian Capital, a journey that would take around six days if all went well. It could be as quick as four but life wasn't always the way.
