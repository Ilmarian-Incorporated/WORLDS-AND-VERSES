# Character
[[Eilert Von Balingen]]

# Starter
Down by the river, he washed his hands clean. Running the frigid water through his dirty fingers. He could hear them coming now.

Approaching his house, they waited for him. A carriage and two constabulary.

"Mr Eilert Von Balingen?" One asked.

"'Ey. That's me." Eilert spoke softly.

"You are wanted concerning a murder." The other man stated.

Eilert's heart rate spiked.

"The Inspector asked us to come here concerning your services as a Detective. You are retired but he wishes to discuss a brief return." The first man added.

Eilert's heart slowed ever so slightly.

"If you will come with us, we can take you to him." The Second man said and Eilert nodded, going to the carriage and boarding it. It would not be far to the city; a brisk walk could take you there.
