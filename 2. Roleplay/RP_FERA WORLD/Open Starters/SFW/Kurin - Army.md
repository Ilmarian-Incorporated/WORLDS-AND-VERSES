# Character
[[Kurin]]

# Starter
[[Kurin]], a name she had been given by her Master but a name she had earned.

Empty in the ancient language of the [[Üstün]], she was just that. Soul-less. Or at least that was what they told her. Her Master she trusted the word of and he was the one to affirm it.

She was on a mission and had made her way through the [[Kuru Alanlar]],  Umissia's broiling desert. She saw the ancient city's entrance. Underground it lay.

She was in the right place.

She had a man to see about an army.
