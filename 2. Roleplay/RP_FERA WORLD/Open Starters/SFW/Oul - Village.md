# Character
[[Oul]]

# Starter
Oul had been in the village recovering for the better part of a month. His body was still weak but he had pushed himself to be stronger, it wasn't right but he did it anyway.

In the middle of of the garden of the home he had been recovering in, Oul swung his sword in his training patterns.

Something was pulling him west. The mountains of The Spin towered in the horizon and he knew it would be his destination.
