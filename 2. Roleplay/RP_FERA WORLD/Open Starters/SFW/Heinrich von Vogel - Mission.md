# Character
[[Heinrich von Vogel]]

# Starter
Winter had begun to set in over The Front and Heinrich came out of the Command Bunker and into the trench, he stared out down the parapet before he took a step up to the fire step and looked out. 

"Cold isn't it sir." Gerke Spreng, his aid and assistant, stepped up with a cup of tea.

"Very." He mumbled and sipped it as he watched the shelling landing on the Alrussian Lines in the far distance. "Just another day on The Front."
