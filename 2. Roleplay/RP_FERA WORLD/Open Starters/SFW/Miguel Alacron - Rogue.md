# Character
[[Miguel Fadrique de Alarcon]]

# Starter
Miguel Fadrique de Alarcon leaned casually against the tavern wall, his hat tilted low over his eyes. His cloak was slung over his shoulder, and he wore a worn leather doublet and breeches, and a belt with several daggers strapped to it. He surveyed the bustling street he knew that trouble had a way of finding him, and he was always ready for a good fight or a quick escape.
