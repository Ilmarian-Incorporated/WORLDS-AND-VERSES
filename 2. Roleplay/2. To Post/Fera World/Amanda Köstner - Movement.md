# Character
[[Amanda Köstner]]

# Starter
Camouflaged by the dense foliage, Amanda Köstner moved with the grace of a predator, her rifle cradled in her arms. The forest whispered secrets to her, guiding her steps with ancient wisdom. Each rustle of leaves heightened her senses, a symphony of nature's cues. She was a ghost in the wilderness, attuned to every breath, every flicker of movement. With every calculated step, she closed the distance between her and her objective. In this arboreal labyrinth, Amanda Köstner was the arbiter of justice, her rifle the instrument of balance. The forest would witness her silent dance, and her enemies would tremble before the wrath of nature's fierce guardian.
