# Starter
Amidst the rubble-strewn streets, Amanda Köstner stood tall, her gaze unyielding. The bombed-out city bore the scars of a relentless war, but in the depths of destruction, a flicker of resistance burned within her. With a bandolier strapped across her chest and determination etched on her face, she was a rebel fighter, ready to challenge the oppressors and reclaim what remained of hope. The echoes of explosions fuelled her resolve as she prepared to rally others, for in this desolate wasteland, Amanda vowed to be the voice of resilience and the embodiment of a shattered city's unwavering spirit.
