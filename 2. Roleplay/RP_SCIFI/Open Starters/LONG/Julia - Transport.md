The dull green glow of the computer graphical display filled the dark pod, a room no bigger than an old school motor vehicle. It was claustrophobic and stuffy, recycled air and water was a common sight on ships like this.

Julia slept in one corner of the pod while Ezra, the man who had killed her father, slept on the other side. They had no matress or bed, just rolled up clothing and padding that allowed them to sleep without being on the hard floor.

They were coming into dock at a refuling station. The long trailer of cargo, going on for miles behind them had been locked in to the holding station and the small pod like ship had made its way to the large docking ring of the old station.

At least on this station they could get out.

"I have some things to pick up." Ezra told Julia. "You go get us some supplies, food and stuff. I'll be back in about.. three hours.," He told her as they finalised the docking; both of them reading off a set of grubby and worn plastic cards held together by a rivet. Ezra knew how to fly this ship, barely so they were both learning at some level.

After docking, Julia put on her fathers jacket, too big for the sixteen year old, she rolled the sleeves up and pulled the real wool lining coat closed around her.

This jacket was probably worth more than the ship, her only possession of her fathers other than the small electro-kinetic blaster or "Pop-shot" pistol. She tucked that into the band of her worn and no longer elastic trousers, tying the old leather belt tighter around her waist.

Stepping onto the station, the stale recycled air of her ship met the stale recycled air of the station, it stank of cabbage and too many feet.

Watching Ezra walk off, she looked around slowly. Now she had to find the market
