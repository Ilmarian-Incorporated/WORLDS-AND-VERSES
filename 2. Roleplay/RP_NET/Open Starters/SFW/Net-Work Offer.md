The dingy streets of the city were full to the brink, so much so you could not even see the sky through the vast haze of buzzing drones, mirky smoke and the towering buildings. It was midday, or it should have been if the sun was visible above the pollution in the atmosphere.

There was a buzzing around, a haze. No one seemed to notice it. Static in the system. It could just be the weather, another EM storm maybe but then they'd announce that.

A voice.

"Good mor... afternoon to you. I have an offer for you." The voice, feminine but yet also masculine in a way. Almost unidentifyable or able to be pinned down.
