# Character
[[Eileen Kästner]]

# Starter
Eileen Kästner was tired of moving. Her mother had constantly met men that disappointed her, she had been cheated on several times and had lost everything every time. 

Eileen just wanted to stay in one place, make friends and live her life. Right now she was sat in the back of the car as they pulled up to the old creepy house on the outskirts of the town. It was a dump, falling apart and probably infested with gods knows what.

The blue haired girl sighed as she got out of the car and watched as the moving company troglodytes began to unpack their things from the moving truck. Taking her single bag up to the top of the house, she found a room and claimed it as her own. Sitting on the floor while they brought her bed up, she waited while she sketched in a small notebook.
