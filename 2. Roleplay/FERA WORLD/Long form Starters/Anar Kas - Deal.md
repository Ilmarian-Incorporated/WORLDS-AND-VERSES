# Character
[[Anar Kas]]

# Starter
In the neon-soaked underbelly of a sprawling metropolis mega city that was Grostade, formerly Vandus before The Night of the Long Night, where the 80's never truly ended, Anar Kas was a lost soul trapped in the siren's call of vice. As an Aşağı, she should have been attuned to the rhythms of nature and the whispers of the ancient woods or at least that was what her mother, her grandmother and the old priests still pinning to the old ancient ways still jabbered on about. Yet, the glitzy allure of the city's lower tier casinos and underground gambling dens had ensnared her like quicksand.

Anar's life had unravelled with every roll of the dice, every turn of the card. She owed money to powerful people, dangerous people, who weren't accustomed to leaving debts unpaid. Among them stood Rose, a notorious businessman with a reputation that resonated far beyond the city limits. Rose wasn't just a man; he was an empire, the orchestrator of a clandestine criminal network with tendrils that reached into the darkest corners of the city.

On a night when desperation clung to her like a second skin, Anar found herself summoned into the opulent penthouse suite of a skyscraper that pierced the heavens. The room was bathed in the flickering glow of vintage  machines and adorned with opulent artefacts, a testament to Rose's extravagant tastes.

As she entered, Anar's heart hammered in her chest. She could feel the weight of the eyes upon her, the glares of enforcers who flanked her like silent sentinels. And there, seated behind a mahogany desk, bathed in the soft light of a neon sign that read "Rose's Paradise," was the man himself.

The letter hand given to her by one of his goons had been simple. "I believe you've lost something," Written in his own hand, stamped with a little seal for even more authenticity "And I intend to collect."
 
Anar's heart had sank as she realized the depths to which her addiction had taken her. In the unforgiving embrace of the cityscape, where greed and power reigned supreme, Anar Kas was about to make a choice that would shape her destiny in ways she could never have imagined.

She stood in front of the man, naked. Her clothes neatly folded by one of the goons and placed on the table front of her. She'd lost them in one of the many bets she'd made. A drunken comment of "All I got's the close on my back" Sealing her bet right there.
