# Character
[[Lorenza de Calis]]

# Starter
In the heart of the bustling City of Tousir, where towering spires of stone loomed over narrow cobblestone streets, Lorenza de Calis had arrived at a pivotal moment in her life. She stood before the imposing bronze gates of the Constabulary, her heart pounding with a mix of anticipation and trepidation. The sun's dying rays cast long shadows, welcoming her into a world of secrets and challenges.

Lorenza was not a newcomer to the city her family were a powerful family and famous names in the military. Except she was not in the military, with sharp eyes that missed nothing and a resolve forged from a life marked by hardships. She had joined the ranks of the Constabulary, the keepers of order in Tousir as she saw it, with dreams of justice and a burning desire to make her mark. But little did she know that her initiation into this venerable institution would be far from easy.

Her mentor, a seasoned officer who had weathered the storms of the City Watch during the most tumultuous of times, was the embodiment of the "old guard." The older men and women of the City Watch had made it abundantly clear that they regarded her and others who had joined this new 'Constabulary with suspicion and disdain. In his eyes, she was merely another inexperienced recruit, a stain on the legacy of the storied City Watch now that it had been renamed and made 'modern'. They were the kind who had seen it all, who had patrolled the cobblestone streets when they were rife with corruption, and lawlessness ran rampant. Which also saw quite a few being corrupt.

Their first encounter had been anything but cordial. Lorenza, eager to learn and prove herself, had apparently messed up something 'simple' but she felt she had not. It was the 'old guard' putting blockers in place to make them fail.

"You think you can walk these streets and play at being an officer?" One had sneered, his weathered face etched with lines of cynicism. "You're nothing more than a nuisance, a distraction to those of us who actually know what it takes to keep this city in check."

Lorenza had gritted her teeth and held back the retort that threatened to spill from her lips. She was determined to prove herself, to earn the respect of her peers, even if it meant overcoming the adversarial relationship with her mentor.

As the first shadows of evening began to blanket the City of Tousir, Lorenza de Calis stepped through the gates of the Constabulary, ready to face whatever challenges awaited her. With a new mentor, she was entering a world where old and new clashed, where traditions met change, and where her journey would be fraught with obstacles. But Lorenza knew one thing for certain: she would not be deterred. She had a city to protect, and she was determined to prove her worth, even if it meant winning over the most stubborn of critics.
