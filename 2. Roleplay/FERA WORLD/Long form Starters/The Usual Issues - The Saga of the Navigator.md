# Starter
In the heart of the Landfall Bay, nestled amidst a landscape of towering factories and bustling port towns, there sailed a remarkable vessel known as the "Navigator." This unusual looking cargo ship was unlike any other, renowned for its unmatched speed and unwavering captain, Wilhelm Friedrich Herzog.

On a crisp morning, the "Navigator" approached the busy harbour of Landfall, its  revolutionary propeller system churning up frothy waves as it powered through the river's currents as they used the . Captain Wilhelm stood at the helm, his gloved hand firmly gripping the ship's wheel as he stood off to one side, leaning to get the view past the sails and rigging. His rugged features betrayed none of the excitement he felt on approaching their destination. Wilhelm's eyes were sharp, a testament to his years navigating the perilous waters of industrial-era trade hub.

As the ship neared the bustling port, a clatter echoed through the vessel and the vessel began to heave to one side for no reason. Something had gone awry below deck, and the ship's mechanic, Greta Eisenhardt, dashed out of the engine room, her face smeared with grease. She shouted, "Captain! The auxiliary Marine Reduction Gearbox's acting up again!"

Wilhelm frowned and glanced off to one side of the vessel and down at the water, the secondary propeller on the right side was clearly acting up. It shuddered and groaned, causing the ship to veer dangerously close to a neighbouring cargo vessel. The crew scrambled to secure the cargo in the open hold after unfastening it ready for a quick unload and reload of new cargo before the Port Authorities decided to board and do a spot inspection, fearing a collision.

In the midst of the chaos, Heinrich MÃ¼ller, the muscle of the crew, heaved a heavy crate into place, his powerful arms working effortlessly. The crate's contents clinked with the promise of precious cargo. Wilhelm yelled at the crew, "Hold fast, folks! We ain't sinkin' today!"

"Sounds like we are." Heinrich called back a little too loudly.

Wilhelm wasted no time. He barked orders to his first mate, Eliza, and together, they rushed to the ship's side, ropes in hand, having tied off the wheel to stop it from pulling off to the side. They rushed down into the engineering section at the back of the ship and saw the steam pouring out of the engine as it loudly chugged along. The gear system was shaking, they could not stop to repair it as it would require a total breakdown of the engine.

"Ah shit." Wilhelm sighed and he tried to get close to sort it out when his jacket began to pull from him. The jolting and jeering had caught it and was pulling it in. Slipping out of the grip of his jacket with the help of Eliza, Wilhelm watched as his jacket was eaten and wrapped around the gear.

However, it then began to run somewhat better. It began to steady up.

"Well that works." He grinned and looked out a window, a ship coming up too quickly.

With sweat beading on his forehead, Wilhelm called out to the crew, "All hands, brace for a rough patch!" Then, he signalled to Heinrich, who stood ready by the ship's anchor controls. With a mighty heave, Heinrich pulled a lever, releasing the anchor and creating a powerful drag on the ship's port side. The "Navigator" groaned and shuddered as the ship lurched to the side, narrowly avoiding a collision with the neighbouring vessel. Wilhelm clung to the ropes tightly.

Wilhelm wiped his brow, a grin tugging at the corner of his lips. "That's how we keep flyin'," he muttered to himself, a testament to the indomitable spirit of the "Navigator" and its fearless crew as they continued their journey through the rugged waters of the 18th-century steam-powered world.
