# Character
[[Ylenia Marcovici]]

# Starter
The war between Ilmaria and Alrussia had gone on and off for centuries, the eternal enemies had even built a momument to their hatred of each other. 

The Front was a border spanning series of trenches and emplacements against to each other. It spread hundreds of miles between coast to coast.

The Ilmarian Imperium in the south had the technological advantages through the ages but the Alrussian Federation had the numbers and resolve.

1922 and the war was once again in full motion. Modern technology  included the cartridge, machine gun and the tank. Long range combat was something that rose from the dominance of artillery snipers developped their skills.

Ylenia Marcovici was one such sniper. She could kill from such a distance that some thought her a myth, she could sneak through the enemy lines and kill with her knife like a ghost.

In the city the Alrussians had called [[Lyubnya]], the Imperials had made such headway into the land that they fortified it with their own trenches. Heavy street to street fighting was a constant. It was the deep in the Winter of 1922, the middle of Godsnight and Ylenia had been crawling through the snow for six hours. She was chilled to the bone and yet would not have chance to use a fire; that brought attention she did not need; she was on the wrong side of The Front. The enemy side.

She had killed three men with her knife, one with a rifle shot timed to the detonation of a howling shell landing a mile away. Now she had to get up to the third floor of the building ahead of her. Covered head to toe in white camo, she slunk into the building, knife out in one hand and her semi automatic [[Stezran]] pistol in the other. Sixteen shots of low velocity power, almost silent but lacked the ability to get through proper body armour.
