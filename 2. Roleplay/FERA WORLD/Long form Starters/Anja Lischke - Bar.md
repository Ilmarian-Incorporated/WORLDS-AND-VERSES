"So, you say you need a pilot."

In the smoky haze of a dimly lit bar, the clinking of glasses and the faint strains of jazz hung heavy in the air. Amidst the patrons, a striking figure caught the eye of those who dared to glance her way. The year was 1912

Anja Lischke, an Alrussian pilot with a reputation as bold as her fiery red hair, stood by the bar, her silhouette framed by the soft glow of a single hanging lightbulb.  

"And there's a matter of utmost importance, and requires my discretion and speed." She grinned drunkenly, holding the bottle of vodka by the neck and blinking one eye at a time.

Anja turned her attention to the princess, her eyes narrowing with curiosity as she looked her up and down, as if t taking her in entirely like a perverted old man in the bar. s the jazz music continued to weave its seductive spell, Anja Lischke grinned.

"Sure, I can get you back home before these bad men find you, rape you, mutilate you, kill you and then do whatever ungodly thing to you, probably not in that order." She grinned and took a deep breath. "Although," She stared at the bottle. "It would be a waste for such a fine bottle to go unpaid for." She suggested. "And I do need to sober up at least a little before I fly."
