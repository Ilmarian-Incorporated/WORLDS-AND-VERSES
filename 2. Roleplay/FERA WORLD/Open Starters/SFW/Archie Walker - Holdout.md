# Character
[[Archie Walker]]

# Starter
The Dragonkin's last push was over. The Ilmarian Imperial Army had won this engagement, but at what cost? They had six rounds to a man left, 150 men to the enemy 5,000! Battle hardened, scale armoured Draconic beasts vs the remains of a garrison.

"Take water men. Ready yourself."
