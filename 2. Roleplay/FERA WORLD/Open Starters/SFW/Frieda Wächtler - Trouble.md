[[Frieda W채chtler]]

# Starter
The neon-lit alleyway served as Frieda W채chtler's battleground, her eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of trouble. Cigarette smoke curled around her, mingling with the faint scent of gunpowder. A wicked smirk danced on her lips, mirroring Revy's relentless determination. Tonight, the streets would tremble beneath her bullets, and those foolish enough to challenge her would learn the price of crossing Frieda W채chtler.
