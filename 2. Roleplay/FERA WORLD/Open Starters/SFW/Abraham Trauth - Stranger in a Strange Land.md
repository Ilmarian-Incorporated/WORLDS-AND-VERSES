# Character
[[Abraham Trauth]]

# Starter
Was many years ago that I left home and came this way, I was a young man full of hopes and dreams. But now it seems to me that all is lost and nothing gained, sometimes things ain't what they seem.

No brave new world, no brave new world.

Night and day I scan horizon, sea and sky, my spirit wanders endlessly, until the day will dawn and friends from home discover why. Hear me calling, rescue me.

Set me free, set me free.

Lost in this place and leave no trace.

Stranger in a strange land.
