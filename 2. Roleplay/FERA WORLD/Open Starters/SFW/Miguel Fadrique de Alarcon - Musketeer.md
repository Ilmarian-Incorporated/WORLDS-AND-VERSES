# Character
[[Miguel Fadrique de Alarcon]]

# Starter
The rogue musketeer leaned against the tavern wall, his hat tilted low over his eyes. He wore a leather jerkin and a sword at his hip, and a sly smile played across his lips. He was waiting for his mark, a wealthy merchant who he had heard carried a pouch of gold coins. As he watched the entrance, he fingered the handle of his blade, ready for any trouble that might come his way. When the merchant finally arrived, the musketeer stepped out of the shadows and approached him with a smooth confidence, ready to make his move.
