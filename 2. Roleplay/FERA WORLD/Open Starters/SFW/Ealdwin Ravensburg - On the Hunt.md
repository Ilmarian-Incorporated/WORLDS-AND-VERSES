# Character
[[Ealdwin Ravensburg]]

# Starter
He looked like shit, Ealdwin Ravensburg had been on the chase for over six weeks. No real rest, only three or four hours to sleep while the warband he was chasing just kept up their speed. There had been no chance for him to catch up unless something stopped them.

Listening through the ground, he knew they were only a dozen or so miles away. So he kept running.

Ealdwin was a mess. Dried blood coated his leather and cloth armour, some his own, mostly the Orcs he pursued. He stank of sweat and looked like shit, torn armour and cloth, equipment carried light and tight to his body as he jumped the small ditch and across the field through the gap in the wheat left by his quarry.
