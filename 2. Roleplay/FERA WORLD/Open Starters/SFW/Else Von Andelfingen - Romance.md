# Character
[[Else Von Andelfingen]]

# Starter
With a snort and a laugh, Else  tried not to laugh even more. "You really call THAT a weapon? Look. Get dressed. I don't know why you're in my room and thought that being naked would somehow romance me into bed with you. WE got a job to do." Aboard the Locomotive heading to Tousir, they were on the way to murder a Duke.
