# Starter
"I'm an old man." Pascal Söllner said quietly as he sat inside the tank. The Capital city of Ilmaria had been under siege since the start of the war and was a ruin. Hiding in the ruins of an old book shop, Pascal stared through the commander slot. Enemy tanks rolling by.

"Keep calm and quiet." He told the crew. "Our boy is stronger, bites harder and we have the element of surprise." He whispered as he peered through the slot.
