# Character
[[Iona La Placa]]

# Starter
Iona relaxed under a tree. The battle was to begin just after midday, out of the midday sun. She waited out in the tree's and watched the other basic soldiers readying themselves. Ever since she was a child she had wanted to be a Knight but that did not mean fighting for some unknown lord over a patch of land.
