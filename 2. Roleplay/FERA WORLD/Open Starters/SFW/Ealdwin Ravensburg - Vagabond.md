# Character
[[Ealdwin Ravensburg]]

# Starter
Here comes a barrow, rumbling down the lane. 
Some call him a thief, some said he was insane. 
Straining in the darkness, sleeping in the day.
That's what they say.  
A lifeless body in a mothy robe.
A worn-out hat and a perforated coat.
Nobody's gonna miss him or gather at his grave.
That's what they say.
  
What's your name, vagabond?  
Where have you been?  
What's your aim, vagabond?  
What have you seen?  
Where do you come from  
And what do you strive?  
Come tell me about a vagabond's life
