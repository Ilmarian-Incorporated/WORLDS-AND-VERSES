[[Abraham Trauth]]

# Starter
"I don't care where you're going or how long you've been out 'ere." Abraham yelled over the rushing wind and snow.

"I'm leading these dogs and you're going to sit quietly there and keep warm until we reach the expedition camp site! I don't care about these 'monsters' in the woods!"
