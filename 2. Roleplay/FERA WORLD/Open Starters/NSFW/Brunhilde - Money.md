# Character
[[Brunhilde Ryserin]]

# Starter
Brunhilde was at it again, she owed money for her stay at the tavern and although she had several good jobs in the area, she had drank it all away. Her child, little baby Florian was upstairs being watched by the owner's mother. She hated doing this, she regretted ever leaving the castle and her friend.

But she had to go on her own, she had to not rely on anyone but herself.
