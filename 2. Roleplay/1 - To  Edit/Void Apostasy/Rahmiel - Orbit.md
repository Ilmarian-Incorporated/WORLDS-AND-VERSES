# Starter
In orbit of Regis VI, the Kingdom Starship "Indominable" transitioned out of the dangerous realm that allowed transport across the galaxy faster than conventional propulsion. It tore through space and dimensions like a vicious wound, bleeding multicoloured light and energy indescribable by human eyes and minds.

The sound it made was lost to the vaccum of the void but would have been that of millions of screams all unified in pain and suffering.

Silently however, the Indominable drifted out, the last tendrils grasping it before the rift behind closed and cut off the foul hordes of indescribable eldritch horrors from entering real space.
