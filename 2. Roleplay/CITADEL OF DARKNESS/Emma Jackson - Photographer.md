# Character
[[Emma Jackson]]

# Starter
Emma was posing for the photographer, another creative. She needed to top up her feeding stock and this was all she could come up with. Terrible.

"Oh yes, you're a great photographer." She lied. Maybe she'd go find that William Blake writer, he had fed her real well during the early 1980's
