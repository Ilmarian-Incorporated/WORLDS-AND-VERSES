# Character
[[Richard Head]]

# Starter
The motel stood as a relic of a bygone era, its weary fa√ßade peeling paint and a faded neon sign announcing "The Roadside Lodge Motel." The dimly lit parking lot held a few scattered cars under a starless night sky. Each room had a solitary window, their curtains drawn to conceal the secrets within. 

Checking the 45 calibre 1911 tucked into his holster under his left armpit, Detective Richard 'Dick' Head stepped out of the old 1960 Black Mustang, its interior showing its old age but not a scratch on the perfect void black exterior. He rushed to the door of the entrance of the old Motel. A sight he had seen many times through the years in various city. A chain of them, it must be; like the chain fast food resteraunts.
