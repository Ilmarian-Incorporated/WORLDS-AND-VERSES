# Lyrics
As sung to the theme of : 

"When duty calls me, I must go"
"To stand and face another foe,"
"But part of me will always stray,"
"O'er the hills and far away."
against anything on the other side. 
"If I should fall to rise no more,"
"As many comrades did before,"
"Then ask the fifes and drums to play,"
"Over the hills and far away."
