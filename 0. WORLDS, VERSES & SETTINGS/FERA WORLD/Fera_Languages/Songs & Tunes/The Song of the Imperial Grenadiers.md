Verse 1: 
From Ilmaria's lands so fair,
We march with pride and hearts to dare,
With muskets loaded and bayonets bright,
We stand together, ready to fight.

Chorus: 
For we are the Grenadiers of Ilmaria, 
With steadfast courage, we never tire,
Our Imperator calls, and we'll answer it,
With strength and honor, we'll always commit.

Verse 2: 
Through fields of battle, we make our way, 
With discipline and skill, we'll win the day, 
Our uniforms are sharp and clean, 
Our regimental flags, a noble scene.

Chorus: 
For we are the Grenadiers of Ilmaria, 
With steadfast courage, we never tire,
Our Imperator calls, and we'll answer it, 
With strength and honor, we'll always commit.

Verse 3: 
The sound of drums, the clash of steel,
Our enemies tremble, their fate we seal,
We stand as one, our bond is strong,
For Imperator and country, we'll right the wrong.

Chorus: 
For we are the Grenadiers of Ilmaria,
With steadfast courage, we never tire,
Our Imperator calls, and we'll answer it,
With strength and honor, we'll always commit.

Outro: 
The Grenadiers of Ilmaria, a mighty band,
Our legacy will forever stand,
For Imperator and land, we'll proudly serve, 
Our spirit and valor, they will preserve.
