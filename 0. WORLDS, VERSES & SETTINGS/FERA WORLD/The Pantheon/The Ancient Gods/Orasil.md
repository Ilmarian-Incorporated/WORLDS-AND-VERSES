Orasil 
	God of Death 

One of the first Gods of Old, Orasil ruled with a mighty fist. His wraith became the very reason for mortality. This became the rule of the God of Undeath & Mutation 

During [[The Great Calamity]], it is stated by records and religious texts he was sealed away by [[Bodar]] and [[Vokmir]] with help of [[Humteus]].  

Several cults still exist praying to Orasil, some of them unknowingly praying to him or some in knowledge. One such cult is "[[The Hand of Orasil]]", part of the larger "[[Cult of Orasil]]", alongside "[[The Head of Orasil]]", "[[The Mind of Orasil]]",  "[[The Soul of Orasil]]", "[[The Finger of Orasil]]", "[[The Heart of Orasil]]", and "[[The Eye of Orasil]]".
