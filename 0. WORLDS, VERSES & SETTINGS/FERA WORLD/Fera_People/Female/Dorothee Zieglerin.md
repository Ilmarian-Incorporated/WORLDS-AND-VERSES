# Summary
An orphan girl taken from the streets in the 1400's, Dorothee was experimented on by an illegal cabal of Entitled to try and harness Aetherial energy in physical form. The experiment was shut down due to its failure and the remaining living experiments left in an Asylum.

For over 400 years Dorothee lived there, her mind broken by multiple personalities of the dead children she had absorbed into her mind and soul. No one knew her true age or background as all files were lost over time. The rotating staff of the Asylum paid no need to the blue haired psycho and would use her often.

All was well until a fire burnt down the Asylum and all occupants were killed.

Or were they?
