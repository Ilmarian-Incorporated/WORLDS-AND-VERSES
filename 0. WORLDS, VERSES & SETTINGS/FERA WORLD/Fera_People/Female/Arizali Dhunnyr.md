# Arizali Dhunnyr

# Summary
Arizali translates as "Defective" into the old [[Üstün]] language. A name given to the young [[Yaralti]] girl due to the defect she carried since birth. 

Arizali was deaf, a thing that would have had her strangled at birth with her very own cord if not for the position her mother held and that she was the first female of the Dhunnyr family to be born. 

And so she got to live.
