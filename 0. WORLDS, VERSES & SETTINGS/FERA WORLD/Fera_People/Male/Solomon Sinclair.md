# History
## Early Life
Solomon Sinclair was born in the [[The Three Kingdoms]] nation of [[Ilmarian Imperium (Nation)]] to a man on the run and a prostitute. As a child he ran on the street and was the head of a small gang of pick pockets.

After some years he attempted to steal from a pair of men, these men were [[Gideon Van der Graphe]] and [[Elias Burress]]. These men were impressed by the young boy and after finding out that both his parents were dead, took it upon themselves to take him in. They taught him to read and write, to count and to work as an actual theif.

## New World
Eventually the Law caught up to the burgeoning [[The Van Der Graph Gang]] and they fled across [[The Windergonie Domain]], the ocean splitting [[The Three Kingdoms]] and [[Pawhye (Nation)]]. The three landed in [[Landfall]] and quickly set upon themselves to make a name for themselves.

[[The Van Der Graph Gang]] slowly grew and as his place as the adopted son of the two founders, Solomon became the Lead Enforcer of the gang.

## Special gifts
It was not until a heist that went wrong that Solomon found out he was even more special than he had assumed., A shotgun to the face resulted in the death of the shooter instead and in the stress of the moment Solomon had backfired the weapon with his hidden powers. Solomon was a [[Gunslinger]], a special kind of mage who uses gunpowder and firearms.

Developing his skills over the years, Solomon became one of the best [[Gunslinger]]s in [[Pawhye (Nation)]].

Usually armed with a pair of cartridge converted [[Darrington 1800 Cap & Ball Pistol]]s and a [[Vanderbilt Lever Action Rifle]], of which the latter was a precious gift from [[Gideon Van der Graphe]] on his 18th bithday.
