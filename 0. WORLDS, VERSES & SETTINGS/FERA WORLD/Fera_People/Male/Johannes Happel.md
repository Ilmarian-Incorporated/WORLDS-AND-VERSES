# Johannes Happel

# Summary
Johannes Happel was Prince Elect of [[The Principality of Laugstrond]] during the years of 1929 to 1950 before his resignation to his successor.

During his early years, 1908, there was an assassination attempt made against his father, then a Duke in the running for the Prince Elect of the Principality. Both he and his father were saved by a member of the [[The Imperial Office of Intelligence and Information]] and [[Special Branch]] officer, [[Pauwell Von Dietingen]]. Unfortunatly his mother was not able to be saved in time.

Several decades later, the pair would meet again on Wineday the 23rd of Heathswrath 1932 during a transit through the Imnperium onboard the famous [[Intercontinental Railway]] to a secret meeting with an Alrussian Delegation attempting to stem an upcoming war with the distant nation of [[Friebruck (Nation)]]. Pauwell would be travelling on the the same carriage, retired from his work in the [[Special Branch]] and [[The Imperial Office of Intelligence and Information]] but still doing occasional work for them.

The locomotive was attacked by the [[Umissian Death Brigade]], an assassin branch thought destroyed decades before, and actually the perpetrators of the initial assassination attempt against his father all those years ago.

Surviving the assassination attempt, Johannes would go on to the meeting, unforuntatly his work never came to fruition as [[Friebruck (Nation)]] invaded in the next few years, sparking the [[The Friebruckian Invasion of The Three Kingdom's]].
