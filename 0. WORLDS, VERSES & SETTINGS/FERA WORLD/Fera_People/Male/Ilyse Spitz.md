# History
Born on Towerday the 17th of Harvest 1996 in the village of [[Kings March (Village)]], a small village set upon the point on the river where [[Imperator]] [[Andreas Vandersryke]] made camp before setting off to retake the city of [[Vandus (City)]] during [[The Night of Long Nights]].

Ilyse was born on the same day as his Neighbour [[Aurelia Rouse]] and would spend their younger years inseperable. The two would become almost siblings as they played and hung out together along with their joint best friend [[Willow Lientzen]]

After the death of his parents, Ilyse had grown discontent with staying in his hometown and joined the Ilmarian Army. Exceeding all the high standards of the trainers, he rose quickly through the ranks. 

After serving several tours on the demilitarized zone between Ilmaria and Alrussia; formerly known as "[[The Front]]", Ilyse was selected for specialist training. Trained as a pilot, explosives specialist and special operations; Ilyse joined the [[Ilmarian's Special Forces]]. 

A number of years into his service with the [[9th Special Detatchment]], Ilyse was selected as one of the first hundred subjects for [[Operation Able Sentry]]. [[Operation Able Sentry]] was a top secret project for the creation of a super soldier to fight and combat The Scourge called a [[Zruhir]]. 

Out of the 100 initial test subjects, only 10 survived, Ilyse one of them. 

And so from these 10 subjects, and with [[Operation Able Sentry]] deemed a failure due to the casualty rate, [[Operation Moonlight]] began.
