# Silas Hulins

# Summary
Born to a farmer in the village of VILLAGE in [[The Principality of Alhuizen]] Silas Hulins led a quiet life until he was constcripted into the Alhuizen army in the outbreak of [[The Principality Wars]] between [[The Principality of Alhuizen]] and [[The Principality of Vesenhaus]]. 

It was on the border and outskirts of the [[Tillcaster River]] or more precisely the [[Atilisle River]] that flowed into the [[Tillcaster River]] along with the [[Reidmeny River]] and the [[Onoway River]] . [[The Beauvon Wood]] sat on its Eastern side and the battle had spilled into the woods. Silas had marched a long way to get there and into his first battle he had stood with the rest of his squad. 
There he had been killed by [[The Knight of Dal-Harad]], or would have been if he had not been found by the [[Dryad]] [[Thylaise nin s'o cima, Murah ve s'o uh'el tan]], a dryad girl on her Pilgrimage.
