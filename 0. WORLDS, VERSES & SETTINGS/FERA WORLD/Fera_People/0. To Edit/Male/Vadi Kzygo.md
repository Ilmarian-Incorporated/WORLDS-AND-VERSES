# Summary
"How do you differentiate between a coward and a patriot? The coward screams when going over, trying to scare the [[Ilmarian]], when the patriot stays quiet knowing that his mere presence sends the Imperials running" 
-Lieutenant Vadi Kzyrgo, [[11th Line of Foot]]

Vadi Kzyrgo, also known as Lieutenant Vadi was an officer of the [[../../../Fera_Events/Wars & Conflicts/The First Alrussian - Ilmarian War/The First War of Alrussian Aggression|[Alrussian]]. He's mostly known for his deeds during the [[Great Retaliation Charge]] when he managed to take an [[Ilmarian]] trench with only the help of his colour bearer [[Corporal Stostky Pavtrov]] and fifteen other men from the [[11th Line of Foot]]. 

The charge ultimately resulted in an Ilmarian victory but not without the destruction of [[Trench 156]] that was vital to the Ilmarian front due to how close it was to the [[Alrussian]] border at the time. For his actions during the charge, Vadi received the [[Cross of Saints]] although he never wore it during his time in the trenches as he feared It would get dirty and dishonour the medal which resulted in only a handful of people knowing that he had it in his possession.

# Appearance
Vadi is always wearing his [[Uniform M-04]] and is rarely seen without it, it consists of a brown jacket with seven buttons and yellow sleeves. Under it, he wears a yellow shirt along with yellow pants that are tailored to cause the least amount of discomfort at all times, this is due to him and most soldiers being expected to live in their uniform during their stay on [[The Front]]. 

On his feet are black shoes with short heels and socks that reach to his lower knees for warmth, as [[The Front]] get's cold during the night. It is especially rare to see him without his ammunition pouch and tricorne hat that seems to always accompany him wherever he goes, on the ammunition pouch is the symbol of the fifteenth Tsar, [[Nicolai Ystrof]]. 

Around his stomach sits a belt that completes the look of his uniform as well as holds his jacket together. 

### Weaponry
In his belt, the Lieutenant is seen carrying a Flintlock pistol that he always has loaded to shoot any coward if the need arises, he also carries a standard-issue rapier that comes with the uniform. In the later part of his life, he also started carrying around a [[Tolokonsky Mk III Rifle]]. 

# Personality
The lieutenant is almost always calm even in the direst combat situations, the truth is that he is freaking out just as much as other people if he is being shot at, but he has been trained in the [[Alrussian officer academy of Zetriski]] to never show any fear and to be an inspiration to the men, but the last part is sometimes hard for him due to his happy trigger finger. If there ever was a situation where Vadi showed his fear, they would surely make him resign. The few times that Vadi has been angry it's always been for good reason, such as when in the unlikely scenario when he has to cooperate with an elf or when people don't listen to him. 

### Abhumans
One thing that Vadi dislikes almost as much as cowardice is abhumans such as [[../../../Fera_Races/Kobold|[Dwarves]] and [[Aşağı]], especially [[Aşağı]]. He sees these beings as inferior and weak compared to human physiology. It does not help that he was betrayed by an elf during one of his missions to a crypt that was revealed under no-mans-land, in the crypt the [[Aşağı]] backstabbed him when he was fighting skeletons that guarded the crypt.
