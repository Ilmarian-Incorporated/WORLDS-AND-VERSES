# Summary
Once a simple girl to a simple family, Arlayna was caught up in a [[Goblin]] raid of her family's caravan, with her mother, father, sisters and brothers killed and sodomised, the girl was quickly taken by the goblins as their next toy. However a passing caravan interrupted the goblins fun, ending in the girls throat being slit by the goblins before they fled.

With medical treatment she hung onto life and with the help of a mysterious [[Witch in the Woods]], the girl was given an elixar to heal her wound, this however had a catch.

Her body began to rot, her skin turned palid and it was evident that she was dying; her brain and soul still intact, the girl had become what [[Lich]]'s and Necromancers had been trying to do for eons, an undead body with its soul intact.

Being stiched back together with fresh parts, the girl now a walking corpse, tried to keep her life together.

Caught on the road by Goblins, her caravan was attacked. The girl was caught and raped, the rest of her family and friends murdered and raped and eaten. As help came to save her, her throat was slashed by the goblin raping her.

Managing to slow the bleeding, she was taken to a nearby healer, a witch. The Witch healed her but told them 'a price would be paid'
