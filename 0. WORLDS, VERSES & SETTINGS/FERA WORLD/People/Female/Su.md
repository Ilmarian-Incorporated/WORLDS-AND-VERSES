# Su

# Summary
Captured by slavers after their ship was boarded crossing through the sea, the child that would be called 'Su' was taken through [[Umissian Republic (Nation)]] as a slave.

On a journey across the [[Kuru Alanlar]], Su would be rescued by [[Ike]]. The woman, also [[Kokkan]], would take the child in and keep them safe, giving them the name Su from the child's tapping of their chest and repeating 'Su'.

'Su' in [[Kokkan (Language)]] means "Little Girl. [[Ike]] believed the child to be a boy but was in fact a girl. A Royal of the Kokkan leadership. It would not be until later in their travels that [[Ike]] would find out the truth.

Upon her return to her home, [[Ike]] would learn the girls real name. "REAL_NAME".
