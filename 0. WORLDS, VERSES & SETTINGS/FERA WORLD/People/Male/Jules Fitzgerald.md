# History
At a young age, Jules was always interested in the military, fantasising about fighting and watching the parading military formations. 

His father was had been an Officer in the [[Ilmarian Imperium (Nation)]] and his life was destined to be one too. 

During his teenage years, Jules was recruited by a Spotter team for the [[Imperator's Special Selection Service]]. The newly formed [[Gunslinger]] Cabal, formed in the wake of the ascension of Imperator Andreas Vandersryke to the throne and a [[Gunslinger]] himself, found Jules to be exactly what they were looking for. 

He had the gift, the abilities of a [[Gunslinger]]. After being put through Cabal training, he was sent to [[The Front]] at the age of 24 on his first campaign as part of the [[125th Ilmarian Line of Foot]] or more commonly known by their nickname "The Black Legion".

It turns out that war was not exactly how he had imagined it and soon the horrors of war turned a once proud boy into a coward and deserter. Fleeing the battlefield and taking to the road. Jules would find himself travelling the length of the Imperium to return home; to admit to his family what he did and beg forgiveness. 

## A Chance Encounter

*Date: Swordsday the 49th of Windsend 1807*

Arriving in the city of [[Stormbury (City)]], the Capital of [[The Principality of Stormbury]], Jules had managed to sneak through the city gates and was planning on taking the locomotive to South; however he was identified by a Military Police officer and chased down. 

During the chase, the [[Gunslinger]] ran into [[Fo Roundfor]], a Kobold Post-keeper whom was on the run for crimes unknown to her. Escaping together into the sewers, Jules took pity on the small meek creature but knew he had to keep moving. He could not face the firing squad before apologising to his family. 

Another attempt to leave the city put Jules in the sights of the cities newly formed [[Constabulary]]. 

Captured and taken to the [[Constabulary]] station for holding, the [[Gunslinger]] thought it was over. 

All until the little [[Kobold]] Post-Keeper snuck her way into the station and busted him out. The two escaped, with Jules killing several officers on his way out, before blending into the city.
