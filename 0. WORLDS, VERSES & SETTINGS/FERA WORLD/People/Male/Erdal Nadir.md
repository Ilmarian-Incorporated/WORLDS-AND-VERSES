# Erdal Nadir


# Summary
Erdal Nadir, or "Eri" as some of his friends called him was an Elf, more precisely an [[Aşağı]]. A "Lower" Elf compared to the ancient [[Üstün]] [[Aşağı]] of ancient legend. He was lithe, tall and almost feminine in his appearance. This did not mean he wasn't strong or manly, in fact he was quite strong and had quite the attitude when pushed.

His long ears showed the [[Üstün]] heritage of the Aşağı, he must have had a long [[Üstün]] line that was only broken by some interbreeding with Humans. There was no dwarf in him, he knew that much, perhaps there was a little Orc in him which disgusted Erdal so much to think about.

If he'd been raped by an Orc or fell for an Orc he'd kill himself outright. Foul creatures.

Erdal had the same fond-ship for the other races as most Aşağı, even in this modern age of acceptance and unity, he hated Humans and Orcs, he tolerated the Dwarves, Gnomes, Halflings and Dragonkin. Although he hated the Humans, he put up with them enough, this was where his attitude usually kicked in.

He looked down on Humans a lot, saw himself better. Most teased him by calling him an [[Üstün]] King, or even more to tease him, an [[Üstün]] Temptress, the [[Üstün]]'s powerful female [[Entitled (Class)]] whom were renown in history for their ability to fuck everything and anything.
