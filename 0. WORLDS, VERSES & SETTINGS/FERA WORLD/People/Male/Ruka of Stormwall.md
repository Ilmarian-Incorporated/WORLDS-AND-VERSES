# History

## Youth

## Shikarii Training

The Shikari castle of [[Gundor]] was as ancient as [[The Order of the Wolf]], maybe even longer. Its current caretaker, [[Daler]], trained many young [[Shikari]] through the years.

## The Beginning

## Prime Years

## The Shade

## Retirement

After the long war with [[The Shade]], Ruka and [[Ara]] had decided to settle down and finally retire from active service in the problems of the world. However this was a lot easier said than done for Ruka, the weary old Shikari could not keep himself down in one place and so on Swordsday the 34th of Dusk 1809 he set off on a little jaunt for a few weeks. 

## Interdimensional Travel
