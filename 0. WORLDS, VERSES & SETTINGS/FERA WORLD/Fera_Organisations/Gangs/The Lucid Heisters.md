# Summary
A gang of teenage students who enter dreams to plan heists and steal information.

When 16-year-old Maximilian Schmidt discovers that he can enter people's dreams, he sees it as an opportunity to pull off the perfect heist. With the help of his friends – a group of mischievous teens known as the "Lucid Heisters" – Max delves into the subconscious of wealthy individuals to plan elaborate thefts. But as the group becomes more successful, they draw the attention of the law and a rival group of dream thieves. As the stakes become higher, Max must decide how far he's willing to go for his criminal pursuits and if it's worth sacrificing his own morals and relationships.
