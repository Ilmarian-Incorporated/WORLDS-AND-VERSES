# Summary 
During the early years of the 1800's and the latter of the 1700's, the [[City Watch]] of most cities were reformed into two separate branches. The Constabulary and the [[City Watch]]. The Watch served as the standing army for defence while the Constabulary acted more as a police force.

With new tactics, equipment and procedures, the Constabulary began to use forensics to find criminals and with the use of Firearms, began to be armed with flintlocks pistols in the early days before moving to pistols in the later years.

Dressed in simple civilian clothes or a uniform of Navy Blue / Black trench coats, the officers were quicker, less inconspicuous and agile.
