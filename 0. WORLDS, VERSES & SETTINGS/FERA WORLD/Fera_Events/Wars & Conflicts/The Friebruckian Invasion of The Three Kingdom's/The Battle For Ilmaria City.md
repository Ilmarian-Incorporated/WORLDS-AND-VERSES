# Summary
During the early stages of [[The Friebruckian Invasion of The Three Kingdom's]], [[Friebruck (Nation)]] had made a two pronged attack to the North and South of [[Ilmaria (Nation)]], they shelled and bombed the capital, [[Ilmaria (City)]] for weeks prior to the main invasion. The mission: Cut the head off the snake.

Once the Capital fell, moral in the [[Ilmarian Imperium (Nation)]] would falter. Or so they believed.

In truth, [[Ilmarian Army]] held off for weeks, the city an almost ruin as it was shelled, bombed and encroached by sheer numbers of [[Friebruck (Nation)]] troops.

However, the Imperium held off long enough for its other forces to regroup and make its way to the capital, taking back the Northern beachhead but failing to remove the south beachhead until later in the war.

For now, [[Ilmaria (City)]] was a ruin. But they held firm. The people would not give a foot to the invader.
