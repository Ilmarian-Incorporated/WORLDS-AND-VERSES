# Summary

The Üstün were once the rulers of [[Fera (Planet)]], but not the first; after rising up from beneath the race now known only as [[Siren]], the Üstün became the dominant race on [[Fera (Planet)]] for thousands of years, all until history repeated itself and the [[Human]] race, along with allies in the other "Lower" races rose up against their masters during the reign of the evil [[Kräl Şah]] [[Yilmazok Akar ]]
