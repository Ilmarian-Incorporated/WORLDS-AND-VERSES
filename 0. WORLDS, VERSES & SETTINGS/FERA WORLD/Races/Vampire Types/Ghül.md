# Summary

A Ghül is a form of a lesser vampire that are created once a Vampire feeds on a creature and then supplies them with their own blood. 

Ghül's do not age like mortals but are not immortal like other higher vampires as Ghül's do not regenerate. Regeneration is what keeps a Higher Vampire practically immortal as their cells constantly heal. A Ghül can be killed and dismembered and will not grow back limbs but limbs can be re-attached through physical and magical means to and used like their old limbs.

Over time, a Ghül will rot away and as their mind and soul erodes, they become rabid and uncontrollable however in the first stages they are exactly like their mortal forms.

Sunlight does damage a Ghül but will not kill them like other Vampires, only weakens them, allowing them to act as minions and servants of Higher Vampires
