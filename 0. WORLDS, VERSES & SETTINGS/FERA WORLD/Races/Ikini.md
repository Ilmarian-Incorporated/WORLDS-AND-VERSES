# Summary

Coming from the land of Ikin, a landmass off the coast of [[Vahai]]; the Ikini are somewhat similar to the ancient race now klnown as "[[Siren]]". They can range in various skin tones and have thick muscle like apendages coming from their skull; much like the hair of many other races. These muscles are sensative and are even known to give away the emotions of the Ikini they are on.
