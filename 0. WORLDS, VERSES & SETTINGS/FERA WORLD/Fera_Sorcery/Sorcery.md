# Summary
Magic in the  world of Fera involves the exchange of power. Nothing is free in the world and to create one must destroy. Also known as equivelent exchange, Sorcery involves the exchange of energy from one place to another.

This energy can come from any source but is most commonly drained from a realm known as the "[[Aether]]", a dimension of pure energy created from the emotions and feelings of everything in the universe. This is the most common form of energy transfer but energy can be transfered from the surroundings and very rarely; themselves.

One's life force is energy and can be drained just as easily as that from the [[Aether]] but can end with the death of the user.

The most common form of Sorcerery in Fera is what is known as "[[Entitledry]] or "[[Entitled (Class)]]"" in the The Three Kingdoms' the lands and cultures of The [[Ilmarian Imperium (Nation)]], The [[Umissian Republic (Nation)]] / [[Umissian Sultanate (Nation)]] and The [[Alrussian Federation (Nation)]].

Other such methods are the [[Vadrassian Sorcery]] methods, using voice and signs to harness the power of the [[Aether]].
