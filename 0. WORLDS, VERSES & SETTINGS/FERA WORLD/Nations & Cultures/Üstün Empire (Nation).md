# Summary
Ruled by a council of [[Kräl Şah]]'s, the Üstün Empire rose from it's subservience to the [[Yaslan Eternal Empire (Nation)]], and would fall to its own slaves in the [[The War of the Slaves]].

Remnants of the Üstün Empire still thrive through the [[Yaralti]] City States, the [[Nargaroth (City)]] lands trapped in [[The Void]]
