#FeraWorld

# Summary

The home land of the [[Üstün Empire (Nation)]]. The Capital City is [[Nargaroth (City)]]. The Isle was situated in ocean known by the [[Ilmarian]]'s as [[The Zentral Zein]] between [[The Three Kingdoms]] of [[Ilmaria (Nation)]], [[Alrussia (Nation)]] and [[Umissia (Nation)]] until [[The War of the Slaves]] where [[Kräl Şah]] [[Yilmazok Akar]] took the isle into [[The Void]] to keep it safe where it has remained ever since.

The disappearance of the isle left a massive void in the surface of Fera where water filled the gap, lowering sea levels throughout Fera significantly, creating new land of a highly fertile nature.
