#FeraWorld

# Summary
A vast underground highway of rail, paths and water ways beneath the surface of Fera seperating the major City-Holds of [[The Kingdoms of the Dwarves (Nation)]].

Very few know about the Highways but it is thought that the [[Yaralti]] sometimes use them although they are higher than the Cavern-Cities of the hidden subterranean elves.
