# Summary
An dimension or plane of existance just outside the mortal one, the Void is a land of pure darkness. No light is found in this realm and although matter like planets, fauna and flora exist, it is in a state of pure darkness.

It is home to The [[Scourge]] and is the hiding spot of The Lost City and Isle of [[Nargaroth (City)]], transported to this realm by [[Kräl Şah [[Yilmazok Akar]] during the final hours of [[The War of the Slaves]]. The [[Üstün]] that followed him, if not protected by his sorceries and enchanted items, were transformed into the [[Korluk]].
