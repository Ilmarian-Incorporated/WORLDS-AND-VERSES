# Summary

Vampires are a creature that subsists by feeding on the vital essence (generally in the form of blood) of the living. 

After [[The Great Vampire Cull]], Vampires were all but made extinct, or so people of Fera thought.

In the modern nights [[The Brethren Court (Nation)]] has succeeded in convincing mortals that vampires are nothing more than myth and their knowledge about vampires is limited to what is portrayed in movies and books. Only a handful of cults and sects, are aware of the existence of vampires and their society, though their information is incomplete.

They are kept tied together in the Court by [[The Brethren Accords]].
