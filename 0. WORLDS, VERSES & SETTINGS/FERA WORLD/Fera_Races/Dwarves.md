#   Summary

Dwarves are a hardy and resilient race, known for their strength and endurance. They are skilled miners and craftsmen, able to work with precious metals and gems with great precision. They have an innate sense of direction, which makes them expert underground navigators. 

They are also known for their love of alcohol and hearty food. They are fiercely loyal to their friends and family, and will go to great lengths to protect them. They are typically short and stocky, and possess a natural resistance to poison and magic.

They are often associated with the earth and stone and have a special connection to it. They can also be skilled warriors, with a particular talent for wielding heavy weapons and shields. They make excellent fighters, but also have good abilities in crafting, engineering, and mining.

The Dwarves were one of the first races to settle Fera, long before [[Human]]s had evolved to their current state as Fera's dominant race. Along with the ancient [[Üstün]], the Dwarves settled many areas of the world and it was not until the Rise of the [[Üstün]] that these races descended and colonised many of the mountains and dug deep into [[Fera (Planet)]], creating vast cities to hide away from their enemies. 

Many Dwarven cities still remain underground or carved into mountains but the Dwarves are not solely live underground, vast cities on the surface and even high up on mountain tops show the Dwarven capability to carve stone. 

One such Kingdom, the [[Maktashish Kingdom (Nation)]] of [[Vadras (Continent)]], is one such sprawling land ruled by the Dwarves.
