# Summary
A race of soulless creatures created by the [[Yaslan (Race)]] for service in the [[Yaslan Eternal Empire (Nation)]]. Created by fusing the soul of a living creature with a mechanically created body, the Ruhsaz are mindless automata that serve the [[Yaslan (Race)]].

The [[Otomatlar]] are a variation of the Ruhsuz that were controlled by the [[Üstün Empire (Nation)]]. Weaker but still significant, these [[Otomatlar]] are no different in appearance than the Ruhsuz, they were twisted and tainted by the [[Üstün Empire (Nation)]] with their Aether Sorcery.
