# Summary
Originally called the [[Ruhsuz (Race)]], the Otomatlar were a race of ancient Automata created by a race long before the [[Üstün Empire (Nation)]] by the [[Yaslan Eternal Empire (Nation)]] and but taken by the [[Üstün Empire (Nation)]] and used against the [[Yaslan Eternal Empire (Nation)]] when their slaves rose up.

Weaker but no less identical to their original form, they were twisted and tainted by the [[Üstün Empire (Nation)]] with their Aether Sorcery.
