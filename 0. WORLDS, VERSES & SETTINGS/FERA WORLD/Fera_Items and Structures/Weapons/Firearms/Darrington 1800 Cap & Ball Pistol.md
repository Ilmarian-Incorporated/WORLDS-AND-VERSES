# Summary

The Darrington 1800 Model Revolvers along with subsequent models and variations were percussion revolvers manufactured by [[Fitzgerald Darrington]] in .31 (Pocket) .36 (Navy) or .44 (Army) caliber, used during the [[Ilmarian Civil War]], and was the beginning of a successful line of medium and large frame pistols. They are commonly, though inaccurately, referred to as the Model 1800 due to the patent markings on its New Model barrels, "PATENTED MID. 22, 1800/F.DARRINGTON, ILMARIA/NEW MODEL."; although wide scale production did not start until 1805

The Darrington 1800 revolver was a secondary, supplemental issue firearm for the [[Ilmarian Imperium (Nation)]]. It saw use in the New World ([[Pawhye (Nation)]]) both in its original percussion configuration and as a metallic cartridge conversion, as well as around the world.
