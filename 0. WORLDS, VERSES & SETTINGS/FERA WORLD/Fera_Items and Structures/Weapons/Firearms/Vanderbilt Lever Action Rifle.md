# Summary
Developped by the [[Vanderbilt Merchantile Company]] as a weapon used by its carridge riders, the Vanderbilt Lever Action Rifle became a common sight in the [[Pawhye (Nation)]] lands as the cap & ball weapons were slowly converted to the cartridge.

Able to fire twelve shots before being reloaded, it carried an impressive range and accuracy.
