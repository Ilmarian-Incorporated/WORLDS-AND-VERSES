# Summary

Created by the last remaining remnants of the [[Üstün Empire (Nation)]]'s foul Sorcerers and Gene-weavers as a last resort weapon against the alliance of races sent against them at the end of their Empire's reign, the Kötü haşere was a disease like bioweapon that could infect simple creatures and set them on a blood frenzy.

It is not transmissible from animals to creatures such as humans but does transmit the [[Isrmak]], a viral infection that once it has consumed the host, attracts the Kötü haşere infected creatures.
