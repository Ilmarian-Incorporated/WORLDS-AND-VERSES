# Summary
A small City Hold under the holding of [[Clan Ironmane]] of [[The Kingdoms of the Dwarves (Nation)]] carved out directly from the Mountains during the 11th Century.

[[Khirndan (City)]] held just over two thousand Dwarves of [[Clan Ironmane]] and had begun as a mining colony of the bigger City-Hold of [[Daghlodihr (City)]] until it had struck a deep vein of gold and silver which eventually created a trade hub to allow shipments to be sent down the Mountains and to the closest Human settlements. 

Technically located in [[The Principality of Tousir]], they easily paid their tithe to the Imperium and then some.
