# Summary

Taikado bridge was named after a monk who had arrived at the site centuries before and needed to cross; however no boats or skiffs were nearby so crafted his own bridge over the next few days out of the bamboo and vines of nearby trees. It was not the prettiest bridge but it did the job and would continue to do the job for another five years until the very same monk passed by during the final days of [[The Great Yorshira War]] and found an army trying to pass over the river. In defiance the monk stood upon the centre and denied any passage by the army. General [[Shigenoi Takatsune]] had enough of the delay and sent a warrior to kill the monk.

However the monk had other ideas.

Instead of killing the warrior in self defence the monk knocked the warrior into the raging waters of the [[Hokotaikado River]]. [[Shigenoi Takatsune]] sent another soldier and again the monk knocked them aside. After twenty men were stuck swimming back to shore [[Shigenoi Takatsune]] sent his best warrior to end this delay.

Knowing he could never bat this warrior aside, the monk destroyed the bridge. Both the warrior and the monk fell into the [[Hokotaikado River]] and unfortunately for both they could not swim. Both drowned in the river but the delay in construction of a new bridge allowed the defenders of [[Yuttoashito]] to be reinforced by nearby allies. [[Shigenoi Takatsune]] was defeated at the final battle of [[The Great Yorshira War]] at [[Yuttoashito]].
