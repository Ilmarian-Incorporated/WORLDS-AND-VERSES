# Summary
Funded by a collaboration with the [[Imperial Royal Cabal]], the [[The Brethren Court (Nation)]] and various technologists, the "Effigy" is an [[Automata]] created not by the [[Üstün]] or the [[Yaslan (Race)]], but [[Human]]-kind. An Effigy is a mechanical creature created using mechanical means such as clockwork windings and eventually, the more advanced "[[Aether]]" crystals developed by a sect of the [[Entitled Cabal]]s.

The breakthrough for their creation was a disgraced [[Entitled (Class)]] turned doctor called "[[Vannozzo de Albrixis]]"., whom found the missing link after studying various [[Automata]] from [[Pawhye (Nation)]]'s [[The Dread Valley]]'.

However he was cast out and his research stolen by his former best friend and student "[[Ramondo Benedetti]]". In secret he worked on modifying the Effigy to be more human-like, to perhaps have a soul.

His first success was [[Princeps]], however it was his last as he was murdered by his former student before he could finish [[Princeps]]; leaving him with a clockwork mechanism but able to take the final [[Aether]] crystals.
