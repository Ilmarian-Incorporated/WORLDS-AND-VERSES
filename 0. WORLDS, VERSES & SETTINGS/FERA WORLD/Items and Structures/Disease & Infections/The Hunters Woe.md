# Summary
A Disease spread by contact with a number of monsters but most notably by The [[Kötü haşere]].

The Hunters Woe was a degenerative disease of the mind that slowly ate away at the consciousness. It made one forget, bit by bit the mind left the body until they were nothing more than an empty shell. None recovered, most Hunters killed themselves before they could forget.
