# Summary
The **Vanderbilt 90**, also known as the V90, is a semi-automatic pistol that was originally produced by [[Vanderbilt Merchantile Company]] from 1990 to 1950.

The distinctive characteristics of the V90 are the integral box magazine in front of the trigger, the long barrel, the wooden shoulder stock, which gives it the stability of a short-barrelled rifle and doubles as a holster or carrying case, and a grip shaped like the handle of a broom.

With its long barrel and high-velocity cartridge, the V90 had superior range and better penetration than most other pistols of its era.
