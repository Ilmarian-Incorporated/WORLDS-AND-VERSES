~ Date System ~
The Dating System of the Kingdom of the Divine, also known as the Kingdom Calendar, is fairly complex in nature, and has been structured so as to deal with the vast amount of recorded history that exists and the massive distances between settled human worlds, which can lead to long periods of isolation. Also the vagaries and time-warping effects of Void Travel can make it almost impossible to keep accurate track of time over long journeys. The Kingdom had developed its own method of recording dates.
A typical date as Kingdom scholars write it would look something like 3.25.375.33. This date can be divided up so that each part is explained separately:
3 - 25 -375 - 33  = Check Number/Year Fraction/Year/Millennium
Check Number
The check number refers to the accuracy of a given date, which is required for clarity due to the common distortions of subjective linear time that occur while travelling within the Void, and inaccuracies in timing on remote or isolated Kingdom worlds and star systems. Check numbers are listed using the following numeric classes:
Class: 0/1 - Home world Standard Date. Referring to an event which happened within the Home System. "0" is most commonly used to refer to an event which actually occurred on the Home world, while "1" refers to an event that occurred somewhere within the Home System.
Class: 2 - Direct. The source for the event the date records was in direct psychic contact with the Home System or the Home world when the date reference was made.
Class: 3 - Indirect. The source for the event the date records was in direct contact with a Class 2 source, though not the Home System itself.
Class: 4 - Corroborated. The source for the event the date records was in contact with a Class 3 source.
Class: 5 - Sub-Corroborated. The source for the event the date records is in direct contact with a corroborated source.
Class: 6 - Non-Referenced, 1 year. The source for the event the date records is not in contact with a Class 0 to 5 source when the date reference was made, though it is a continuation of a time line referenced by a Class 0 to 5 source.
Class: 7 - Non-Referenced, 10 years. As with Class 6 sources, but with a greater time span to allow for larger inaccuracies.
Class: 8 - Non-Referenced, 11+ years. As Class 7, though unsourced for a longer period of time.
Class: 9 - Approximation. For when worlds using a non-Kingdom calendar must reference an event in that world's history.
Year Fraction
For record-keeping, each year is divided into 1000 equal parts, numbered 001-000, rather than months or weeks. Note that this system is not generally used by Kingdom citizens in everyday life, but is simply for administrative use.
Year
This is the year within the millennium, running from 001-999. For general dates, often only the year and millennium are included, such as 123.21.
Millennium
This is the millennium since the birth of the ancient human religious figure that would grow to become the Holy One.
