# Summary
The main location for the short story [[The Midnight Carnival (Short Story)]].

Nestled among the rugged peaks of the Midwest, Willowbrook was a mountain town that seemed to defy the norms of its surroundings. With a population that barely reached a few thousand, the town exuded an aura of peace and seclusion. Its residents were familiar faces, and in a place where everybody knew your name, a strong sense of community prevailed.

Willowbrook's architectural charm was a testament to its storied history. The town was graced with a delightful mix of old-world elegance and rustic simplicity. Historic building adorned with simple exteriors, built during the towns first settlement and heavily maintained were matched by the, then modern now older 80’s and early 90’s brick, concrete and working facades. The town’s main road was what you would expect from a small Midwest town. Lined with stores that had ran in the families of the occupiers since the towns beginnings as a lumber and mine settlement. ‘Old Jane's Hardware Store’, ‘Willowbrook General Store’ and ‘Wilkinson's & Sons Bakery’ some of the key stores of the town. No big chains, no big restaurants just a family run diner.
