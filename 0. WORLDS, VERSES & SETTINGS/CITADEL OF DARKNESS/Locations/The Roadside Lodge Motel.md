# Summary
A [[Transient Zone]] in the appearance of an old retro motel. Appearing in several cities at the same time. Rooms seem to switch and change at its own will.

# Description
The motel stood as a relic of a bygone era, its weary fa√ßade peeling paint and a faded neon sign announcing "The Roadside Lodge Motel." The dimly lit parking lot held a few scattered cars under a starless night sky. Each room had a solitary window, their curtains drawn to conceal the secrets within. 

A flickering vacancy sign buzzed intermittently, casting eerie shadows that danced on the cracked pavement. Inside, the air held the faint scent of aged memories and stale cigarettes, a timeless aroma shared by all motels of its kind. It was a place where travellers stopped briefly, leaving little trace of their existence, and where the passage of time had rendered it no more than a stopover in the journey of countless others.
