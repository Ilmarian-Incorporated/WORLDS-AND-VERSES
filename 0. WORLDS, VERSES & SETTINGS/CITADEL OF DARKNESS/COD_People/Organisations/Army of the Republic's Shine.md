He explained. “Which is why we carry these.” He motioned to a small box on his belt which showed a dull green LED light in the corner. 


"If this is green then no shadow around you can be used by a Darkness Generator; it emits a field of Electro static and what we call a Luon field to disrupt the wave length used by Darkness Generators. It was created by Professor Luon, a personal friend of mine before the Soldiers of Darkness took him out to be hanged in front of his lab, a message to those who wanted to fight the Darkness.”
