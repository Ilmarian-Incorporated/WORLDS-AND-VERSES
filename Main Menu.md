# Metro Of Ashes

## Summary
Welcome to the World of "Metro of Ashes." A hundred or so years after a catastrophic war, the world is a wasteland of frozen radioactive shit., Humanity survives in bunkers and underground facilities; few alive remember what happened or what caused their extinction.

Some say nuclear war, some say extra terrestrial beings.

What people do know is they are safer underground in the Ashes of the Old World.
