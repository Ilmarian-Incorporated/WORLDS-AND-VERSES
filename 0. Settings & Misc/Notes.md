# Desert Rat Story Idea's

[[Ike]]

In "Desert Nation," [[Ike]]'s story of escape is intertwined with a subplot involving ancient Elvish artifacts. As [[Ike]] and the child travel through the desert, they come across various ancient ruins and artifacts that hint at a rich history of an Elvish civilization that once flourished in the region. [[Ike]] becomes fascinated by these artifacts, and starts to study them in her spare time.

As she delves deeper into the Elvish history, she discovers that the artifacts hold clues about a powerful ancient magic that could potentially be used to help her and her group in their journey. She starts to collect these artifacts and keep them hidden from the slave masters, in order to keep them safe and study them further.

The subplot adds an element of mystery and intrigue to the story, as [[Ike]] uncovers more and more about the ancient civilization and its powerful magic. The artifacts also become a powerful symbol of hope for [[Ike]] and her group, as they represent a past where freedom and self-determination were valued.

As the story progresses, the subplot becomes increasingly intertwined with the main plot, as [[Ike]] and her group use the knowledge and the power of the ancient artifacts to aid them in their journey. In the climax of the story, [[Ike]] and her group must use the artifacts to defend themselves against the slave masters and escape the desert nation.

The subplot of ancient Elvish artifacts adds depth and complexity to the story, and also expands on the themes of freedom and self-determination. It also shows [[Ike]]'s determination and resourcefulness as she uses all the means available to her to escape slavery and find freedom.
